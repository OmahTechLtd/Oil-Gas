# Oil and Gas Predictive Maintenance

In this project, we explore how machine learning can be applied to predictive maintenance in the oil and gas industry.  
The goal is to use sensor readings and equipment data to predict failures before they occur. This can help reduce downtime, improve safety, and save costs.

## Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2. Visualize important patterns and correlations in the data.
3. Build predictive models to classify different types of equipment failures.
4. Evaluate model performance and interpret results.
5. Demonstrate how AI can provide value in oil and gas operations.

## Dataset
We are using the **UCI Predictive Maintenance dataset**, which contains equipment operating data and failure labels.  
This dataset is a good starting point for simulating how predictive maintenance can be applied in real-world oil and gas settings.

## Workflow
- Load and clean the dataset
- Conduct EDA and visualize key features
- Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Compare results and highlight insights
- Prepare charts and visuals to showcase in the demo web app

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, we will demonstrate how AI models can detect early warning signs of equipment failure.  
This serves as a proof of concept for intelligent maintenance systems in oil and gas, while paving the way for future use with real Nigerian datasets.
